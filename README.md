I have attached my code for finding amenities around a user-input location. 
I have included all instructions for my code in the notebook. Before running this notebook, you will need a Google API key, which you can sign up for here: Google Cloud Console. 
Once you have completed the sign-up, you will need to set up your billing account to get $450 in free credit for 90 days. 
After that, enable the Places API and Geocoding API in your account and create an API key.
